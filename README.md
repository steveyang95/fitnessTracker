### rspec
RSpec is for testing purposes. You should try to test each method even though it may seem like simple code. [Here](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails) is a link to the rspec-rails gem, which will give you more documentation and rules. RSpec tests are under the 'test' directory. To run RSpec, run `bundle exec rspec`. Red in rspec means that it is not passing. Green means that the tests are passing.
